# bzz v0.15.0 validation

**Status:** M0 in progress on branch `v0.15.0` (PR #9). Nothing is
implemented in bzz yet. Plan:
[`docs/planning/2026-11-13/v0.15.0.md`](planning/2026-11-13/v0.15.0.md).
Method: [`bzz-prove-it-works`](../.agents/skills/bzz-prove-it-works/SKILL.md).

Buzz pin `bf3bdd0eaefe39289bf9620594f254c7f68897f5`, Rust 1.98.1,
`@earendil-works/pi-durable` 1.5.0. The spikes named below live in
`runs/experiments/agents/pi-durable-harness/spikes/` (local and untracked),
each with the commands to repeat it in `spikes/README.md`.

## M0 — Baseline and the unknowns that can change the plan

### Experiment 1 and 4: one ACP client, four harnesses (2026-11-13)

Linux x86_64, Node 26.5. A minimal ACP client (`m0-acp-client/acp-client.mjs`)
starts a harness, opens two sessions in the same process, gives each a `send`
tool with its own credential, and prompts both at once. The coding agents are
the owner's installed programs with his own sign-ins (D17).

| Harness | Speaks ACP | Two sessions in one process | Each answer sent through the tool, from the right session |
|---|---|---|---|
| bzz's Pi Durable host (stand-in model) | itself | yes | yes, asked over the ACP pipe |
| Grok Build 1.0.77, sandbox profile `workspace` | itself | yes | yes |
| Claude Code 2.1.322 through `claude-agent-acp` 0.101.0 | adapter | yes | yes |
| Codex 0.166.0 through `codex-acp` 2.5.0 | adapter | yes | not reliably |

- **D12 (one process per agent) holds:** every harness kept two sessions
  apart in one process.
- **D15 (one ACP client) holds** for starting a harness, opening sessions,
  prompting and serving the tool.
- **D16 (Codex experimental) is justified:** in three of four runs Codex
  called `send` with `message` where the schema says `text`. Refused with a
  message naming the right argument, it retried correctly once and gave up
  once, ending one turn with plain text and one with nothing.
- **Two rules added to M1 because of this:** bzz checks tool arguments and
  says what is wrong; and a turn that ends without a final `send` has a
  defined outcome. Claude Code writes plain text after it sends, so that text
  is published only when no `send` happened.

Not tried: a shell command or a file edit by a coding harness, a restart with
a harness's saved session, a cancelled turn, macOS, Windows.

### Pending in M0

| Item | State |
|---|---|
| Experiment 2: how Buzz 1.0 shows an agent whose `runtime` it does not know | not run |
| Experiment 3: the role Buzz 1.0 gives an agent it adds to a channel, and whether bzz v0.14 lists that agent | not run |
| Baselines fixed in the repository: the host's `package.json` and lock file, Node detection | not done |
| ADR "local agents" | not written |

## Evidence gathered before the plan (2026-11-13)

These spikes ran before any product code and are the reason for the design.
They prove nothing about bzz itself yet; each becomes a test in its milestone.

| Spike | Claim | Result |
|---|---|---|
| S2, S3 | a Pi Durable host as a separate process answers a mention on the pinned relay through the v0.13 broker, and is killed after the publish | one reply on the relay with "one final reply per mention" kept on bzz's side; two without it |
| S8, S9 | the agent's disk in SQLite, with a shell and git that start no real process, is a valid Pi Durable environment | a 40 MB repository cloned with 0 of 457 files different from real git; push and pull against real git; 30 kills, 0 inconsistencies; Pi Durable's suite 24 of 24, 7 failing with two planted faults |
| S10 | the pinned `buzz-acp` starts the host over ACP | reply in 1.1 s; the conversation survives a `buzz-acp` restart; a mention handed over twice is answered once; `!shutdown` stops it |
| S11 | a move carries memory and disk | the remote copy answers once and continues the conversation; the agent's file is on the moved disk |
| S12 | a real model through Pi's own login | answers through the tool, remembers, publishes once after a kill |
